# Horiseon Refactor
This Repository is where I refactored code from Horiseon's homepage to make both the page more user friendly and accessible, and the HTML and CSS clean, concise, and readable for other collaborators.

# Refactored HTML Details
  - All HTML revised to reflect industry standard.
  - Faulty links debugged.
  
# Refactored CSS Details
  - Reordered to follow HTML structure.
  - Selectors renamed and consolidated for clarity.
